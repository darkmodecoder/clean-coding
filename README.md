# clean-coding  

## learn to write the right code  

In schools we are taught about the syntactical, semantical and somewhat logical aspects of coding  
This is the bare minimum know-how required for you to create your own applications  
IT industry doesn't work like this, it definitely demands more from the devs  
You need to have **clean coding practices** as you will be working with thousands of other employees simultaneously  
This repo will help you achieve your goals in clean coding  

## happy coding
